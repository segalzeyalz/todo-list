A todo list application built using Angular is a web application that allows users to create and manage a list of tasks. This can include adding new tasks, editing existing tasks, marking tasks as complete, and deleting tasks. Angular is a JavaScript framework for building web applications, and it can be used to create a wide range of interactive and dynamic features for a todo list application. Some of the key features that could be implemented in an Angular todo list include:

A user interface for adding and editing tasks, including form inputs for task title, description, and due date
A display of all tasks, including their current status (e.g. incomplete, complete)
The ability to mark tasks as complete or incomplete
A way to filter and sort tasks, such as by due date or priority
A way to delete tasks
